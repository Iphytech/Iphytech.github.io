## What is a blockchain ?


Blockchain is a globally shared  transactional database, which means that it is accessible to everyone through the network. There is no law, or regulation guiding it, which makes it difficult to control, change or hack. 
This system has been proven to be the best way to store and track assets(something physical or non-physical). 

Essentially, it is also a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across all the entire networks in a computer systems on the blockchain.


This computer systems are refered to as nodes, any electronic device that has copies of the blockchain and keeps the network functioning. See more on blockchain [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSo_EIwHSd4)

Now, let's bring it down to a layman's language, from the diagram, we have 4 nodes(A, B, C, D of computer systems) connected to this database in the network(blockchain), it means that once a block is created, a hash is also created 
which makes it difficult to tamper with, once a block has been created, it become difficult to change. The data depends on the type of a blockchain.
