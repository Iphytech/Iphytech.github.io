## What is a blockchain ?


Blockchain is a globally shared  transactional database, which means that it is accessible to everyone through the network. There is no law, or regulation guiding it, this makes it difficult to control, change or hack. 
This system has been proven to be the best way to store and track assets(something physical or non-physical). 

Essentially, it is also a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across all the entire networks in a computer systems on the blockchain.


This computer systems are refered to as nodes and they are located around the whole which makes it decentralized network. See more on blockchain [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSo_EIwHSd4)

Now, let's bring it down to Google doc,when we create a document and share it with a group of people,the doc is conveyed rather than duplicated or moved. This makes a decentralized appropriation chain that gives everybody admittance to the record simultaneously. Here, nobody is locked out anticipating changes from another party, while all alterations to the doc are being recorded continuously, making changes is totally straightforward. So, tampering/changing stuff on the doc will be difficult. You see the power of blockchain!! It solves the problem of manipulation. This has empowers trust, durability and longevity.
